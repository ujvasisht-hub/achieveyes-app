**Individual Features Phase 1**

1. Write down the Goal that you have  
2. Write down the why you want to achieve this dream. The user should be able to write why 5 times and then drill down to the real goal  
3. Then the user writes down the real goal  
4. Write down by when do you want to achieve that goal  
5. Set up process goals and habits goals that you need to build to achieve your real goal  
   1. Process goals \- what process you have to do in the-  
      1. Next 24 hours  
      2. Next 48 hours  
      3. Next 7 days  
      4. Next 1 month  
      5. Next 3 months  
      6. Next 6 months,   
      7. Next 1 year  
         (the timeline changes depending on the timeline of the user; by when do they want to achieve that goal)  
   2. Habit goals \- what habits do you need to develop to reach your real goal  
      1. And what habits do you need to let go to reach your real goal  
      2. Every new habit goal is tracked for 21 days daily without fail. If a user fails to accomplish a habit goal in 1 day, he has to start the 21 days cycle again. This 21 days is to ensure that the habit has been internalized by the user’s mental and physical system  
   3. Process goals will become your checkpoint and milestones, and habits become your motivator to get things done when you feel like “let’s skip today”  
6. The app creates a plan for the goal for each day, week, month, quarter and year  
7. The app checks in with you daily  
   1. The user needs to check either of the 2 boxes for each check in, accomplished, or not accomplished.   
      1. If accomplished, the user has successfully completed a process goal set for that time and now moves to the next one,   
      2. If not accomplished, then the app recalibrates the users process goals so that they can still reach their goal by their timeline. This may mean they might have to do double work tomorrow, or do a little extra work for the next 2, 3, or 4 check ins  
8. The app shows you your progress towards milestones   
   1. The ideal progress is a straight line but rarely so. As long as it is moving forward at a sustainable pace, following the process goals and the habits goals, the progress is good  
9. The app celebrates your success when you achieve process goals, habits goals, milestones and goals  
10. The app motivates you when you miss process goals, habits goal, milestone to keep at it and make up for progress  
11. The app is your accountability coach towards your dreams

**AI Features**

1. When writing a goal, the app suggests the correct format of the goal- with the correct mindset  
2. The app creates a daily plan for the goal with AI keeping into account what needs to be done and how much time is there to achieve the goal.   
   1. This daily plan is incremental in nature, so for example if you have a goal of fitness and weight loss, the app creates a fitness plan and nutrition plan where it has checkins for daily workout and daily nutrition adherence  
   2. The app creates a journey graph for your progress and add to that journey based on your progress.  
3. The app shares motivational snippets daily to ensure that you are following up on your goals and daily tasks  
4. The system should understand the user’s goal, come up with habits that are necessary to develop in life that will optimize his life to reach that goal, then what habits are holding the user back, and what habits to build. The net result of habits will be the habits of the user who actually has achieved that goal  
5. 15 minute time blocks during the day \- user gets 15 minutes for the first 7 days to write down what are the habits that are stopping him and what are the habits that are propelling him towards the goal. \- the system should see what needs to change and then develop them into the habits target list and bake them into the daily tasks
